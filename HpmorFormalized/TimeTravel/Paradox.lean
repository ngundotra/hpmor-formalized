# Deterministic Time Travel: Fixed-Point Resolution of Paradoxes

**HPMOR Chapters**: 11-17, 61-63 (Time-Turner rules and paradox avoidance)

**Claims Formalized**:
In HPMOR, the universe enforces consistency on time travel: if you attempt to
create a paradox (e.g., going back in time to prevent your own time travel),
the universe "finds" a consistent resolution — often a surprising third option
that the time traveler didn't anticipate. This is the grandfather paradox and
its resolution via fixed-point theory.

We formalize a simple model of deterministic time travel with discrete time and state,
and prove that closed causal loops require a fixed-point resolution to maintain consistency.

## Overview

- **State**: A discrete type with three values: `ActionA`, `ActionB`, and `UniverseOverride`.
- **Time**: Discrete time, modeled as `ℕ`.
- **Forward transition** `F : State → State`: represents normal causal evolution.
- **Backward causal function** `B : State → State`: represents information sent back in time.
- **Axiom of Consistency**: A closed causal loop is valid only if there exists a state `s`
  with `s = B(F(s))`, i.e., `s` is a fixed point of `B ∘ F`.

## Main Results

1. **Paradox**: When `F` swaps `ActionA ↔ ActionB` and `B = id`, neither `ActionA` nor
   `ActionB` satisfies the consistency axiom — no fixed point exists among those two states.
2. **Resolution**: Introducing `UniverseOverride` with `F(UniverseOverride) = UniverseOverride`
   provides a fixed point of `B ∘ F`, resolving the paradox.
